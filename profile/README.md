# LiMon — License Monitoring System

**On-premises license monitoring for engineering software.**

LiMon polls FlexLM, RLM, LM-X, and DSLS license servers, collects real-time usage data, tracks historical patterns, detects inventory changes, and generates actionable reports — all without installing agents on your license servers.

## Key Features

- **Multi-vendor support** — FlexLM/FlexNet, Reprise RLM, X-Formation LM-X, and Dassault DSLS
- **Real-time dashboard** — Self-contained HTML dashboard regenerated each polling cycle
- **License inventory tracking** — Detects changes to license files with full audit trail
- **Historical usage analytics** — Time-series snapshots, hourly/daily aggregations, user activity
- **REST API** — Live status, trend data, admin control, and configuration management
- **Intelligence Reports** — Savings Report (cost vs. usage) and Audit Defense (compliance readiness)
- **Air-gap friendly** — No CDN dependencies, no phone-home. Fully self-contained.
